# App instructions
1. First screen: type a city. Major cities in the US work. Basically any city that will be on YELP.
2. Second screen: Select locations you want to visit with the switch. Also, tap on the area outside the switch for a cool folding view. (Works even better on an actual phone!). Try out the call, yelp buttons. Press "Go!" when you once you have selected the locations you want to visit. Please make sure you select less than roughly 5-6 places, because otherwise no tour will be found and the app might crash for now.
3. Third screen: Optimal tour found in order from left to right. Tap on the collection view cells to get more info. Try out google maps, uber integrations. [try to see what happens on the google maps icon for the last entry :D]
